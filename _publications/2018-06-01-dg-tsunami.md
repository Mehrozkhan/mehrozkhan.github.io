This paper is about Tsunami simulations using a Discontinuous Galerkin method for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations. We present a method that is well-balanced even when wetting-drying and dynamically adaptive meshing is considered. We demonstrate this using large-scale tsunami simulations such as the 2011 Tohoku tsunami. Results are compared to real-world measurements.
