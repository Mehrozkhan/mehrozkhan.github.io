title: "Generating Liquid Simulations with Deformation-aware Neural Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-09-28-liquid-deformation-networks
excerpt: 'This publication proposes a method of using neural networks to generate liquid simulations on the fly. Space-time datasets are used to learn deformation networks which can reconstruct a new space-time dataset that the network is fed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, by doing this on a smartphone in real-time.'
