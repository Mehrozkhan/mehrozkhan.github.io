Hi, I am a recent PhD graduate from EPFL in the field of Applied Mathematics. My interests lie in Machine Learning, Numerical Linear Algebra and Algorithms in general. In particular, I like numerical algorithms that are practically applicable to solve challenging real-world problems in Science and Technology. I also like to put theory into code and write software that provides some value to others.

As of now, the website is still under construction. In the meantime, you can check out some of my tsunami simulations. For more info, check out the publications page.
