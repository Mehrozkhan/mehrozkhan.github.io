Hi, this is my home on the web. I am Boris, Physicist, Aerospace Engineer and currently a PhD student in Mathematics. This website is intended to be a collection of all things that interest me. Apart from the obvious ones like Numerics and Mathematical Modelling, there are Paleontology, Algorithms, Economics, AI, Music and many more.

As of now, the website is still under construction. In the meantime, you can check out some of my tsunami simulations. For more info, go to the publications page.
