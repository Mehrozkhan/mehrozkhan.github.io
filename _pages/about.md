Hi, I am a recent PhD graduate in Applied Mathematics from EPFL in Lausanne. My interests lie in Machine Learning, Numerical Linear Algebra and Algorithms in general. In particular, I like numerical algorithms that are practically applicable to solve challenging real-world problems in Science and Technology. I also like to put theory into code and write software that provides value to others.

This website is in an eternal state of construction, so feel free to just explore. I am planning to regularly publish articles on things that I am thinking about, so feel free to check out the blog posts. If you are interested in my research, check out the research section.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to use the social media links on the left.
