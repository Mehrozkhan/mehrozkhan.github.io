Hi, I am a researcher in the field of Applied Mathematics with special interest in Numerical Linear Algebra, PDEs and Statistical Learning. In other words, I like numerical algorithms that are applicable to real-world problems. I have previous studied Physics and Aerospace engineering. Currently I ma pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics with Prof. Jan S. Hesthaven. This site is intended to be a collection of all things that interest me. Hopefully, one day I will get to that.

As of now, the website is still under construction. In the meantime, you can check out some of my tsunami simulations. For more info, check out the publications page.

Still here? My most recent work includes some cool pictures of harmonic functions on a guitar:
