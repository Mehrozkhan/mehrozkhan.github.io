Hi, I am a ML/AI Engineer at NVIDIA and a recent PhD graduate in Applied Mathematics from EPFL in Lausanne.

I am interested in almost anything related to Algorithms. I have worked on topics related Machine Learning, Numerical Linear Algebra and Scientific Computing. If you would like to learn more about my previous work, you can find my dissertation [here](/files/thesis_compressed.pdf). For more, check out the publications page and my recent posts where I write about anything that sparks my interest.

This website is in an eternal state of construction, so feel free to just explore. If you like the contents and/or would like to get in touch, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonevbs/) to get in touch with me.
