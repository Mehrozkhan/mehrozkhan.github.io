Hi, I am a recent PhD graduate in Applied Mathematics from EPFL in Lausanne.

I am interested in Machine Learning, Numerical Linear Algebra and Scientific Computing. If you would like to learn more about my previous work, you can find my dissertation [here](/files/thesis_compressed.pdf). For more check out the publications page and my recent posts where I write about anything that sparks my interest.

This website is in an eternal state of construction, so feel free to just explore. I am planning to regularly publish articles on things that I am thinking about, so feel free to check out the blog posts. If you are interested in my research, check out the research section.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to use LinkedIn to get in touch with me.
