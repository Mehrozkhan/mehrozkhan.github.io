While physics aims to describe nature in terms of mathematics, numerical mathematics aims to represent nature on a computer. This talk will show how we develop a computational model with the example of large-scale tsunami simulations. Finally, we will see how we can use these models to gain a better understanding of our world. Numerical mathematics brings together physics, computer science, engineering and of course, mathematics.
